My first trek in to the tech world
I'm trying to figure out if coding is something I'd be interested in.  I'm a creative person, but know jack about tech. It's obviously the wave of the future, and I'm dipping my toes into the water.  I like the idea of being able to work from anywhere rather than having to be fixed geographically to a government center (federal or state) in order to find work for my present career as a macro social worker (I work in government policy and administration).  The times I've enjoyed my work the most is when I had to learn how to create pivot tables in Excel and spent a couple of days learning from YouTube and playing with a product that I designed for an intended task.  It was praised and rewarding.  Those days flew by; however, on a regular basis, my day is paced by me and can be as productive as I want it to be.  Having that previous project gave me a sense of purpose and accomplishment.  I was able to produce something tangible, which is why I think I'd enjoy this coding thing.  I'm intimidated, however, by how long it'll take to be proficient, especially since I'm a family man with two young children and a wife who'll dismiss this as another tangent that I get gung-ho about and then leave to collect dust once I realize it's not pragmatic.
